This library is part of the Pony Preservation Project. It is designed to
support the development of 2D animation AI. It has three main functions:

    - Support to creation for SVG spritemaps for XFL files.
    - Convert XFL files into a tabular data format. The tabular data will
      eventually contain ALL data necessary to fully recreate the original
      animation, and the data will be hierarchically structured to match the
      original XFL file.
    - Render tabular animation data. The tabular data may be exported from
      existing XFL files, or they may be programmatically generated.

This project is currently in an early stage. The format will change over
time as we identify exactly what XFL data is necessary to recreate
animations, as will the rendering code.
